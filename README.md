Welcome to My Data Science Projects Repository!
Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I showcase a variety of exciting data science projects. Below, you'll find a brief overview of each project along with the associated files. Dive in and explore the world of data science with me!

Projects
1. Car Price Prediction
This project focuses on predicting car prices based on various features. Using advanced machine learning techniques, I built a model that can accurately estimate the price of a car.

Files:
PRJ Car Price Prediction (1).ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
PRJ Car Price Prediction.html: HTML version of the notebook for easy viewing.
audi.csv: The dataset used for this project.
2. Customer Loan Classification
In this project, I developed a classification model to predict whether a customer will be approved for a loan. This can be particularly useful for financial institutions to streamline their loan approval processes.

Files:
classification_algorithm_on_loan_of_customers_dataset (1).ipynb: Jupyter Notebook detailing the steps taken to build the classification model.
classification_algorithm_on_loan_of_customers_dataset (1).html: HTML version of the notebook.
loan_train (1) (1).csv: Training dataset used for model development.
loan_test (1).csv: Testing dataset for model evaluation.
3. Movie Recommendation System
This project involves creating a recommendation system to suggest movies to users based on their preferences. Leveraging collaborative filtering and other recommendation algorithms, this system aims to enhance the user experience in choosing what to watch next.

Files:
movie_recommendation (1).ipynb: Jupyter Notebook showing the creation of the recommendation system.
movie_recommendation.html: HTML version of the notebook.
movies (2).csv: Dataset containing movie information.
